# Lighttpd Configuration File
#
# To use this configuration it requires that you have "mod_alias" enabled in
# your main lighttpd server configuration (usually lighttpd.conf). Then add the
# following line to your default server / virtual host configuration:
#   include ${APP_HTTPD_CONFIG}
#
# Then reload the server. You can then access your source application with this
# URL:
#   ${LOCALHOST_APP_URL}

$HTTP["remoteip"] =~ "127.0.0.1" {
  alias.url += (
    "/${APP_NAMESPACE_AS_PATH}/" => "${APP_DOCUMENT_ROOT}"
  )
