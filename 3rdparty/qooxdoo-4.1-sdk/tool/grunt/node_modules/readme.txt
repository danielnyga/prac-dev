What:
  This is not a regular "node_modules" dir:
    * no npm packages should be installed here.
    * this is just a library dir for Node modules.
    * actually "lib" would be more appropriate as dir name but
      we are exploiting the require() algorithm from Node.js here

Why:
  * these packages are used directly by the toolchain infrastructure
    code and therefore don't belong to a specific package
  * theoretically they belong inside a "package.json" which would
    reside in tool/grunt (the grunt root path).
    Maybe this will be the way to go ...

Requirements:
  * a package added here should have no dependencies (meaning
    dependencies from "package.json") to keep this dir tiny
