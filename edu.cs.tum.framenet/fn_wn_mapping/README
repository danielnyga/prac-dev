This data set includes a mapping between FrameNet verb lexical 
units and WordNet senses. 

The mapping is stored in the file FnWnVerbMap.1.0.txt. There are 
3,094 entries in this file, each corresponding to a verb lexical 
unit in FrameNet II. Each entry includes the following fields:
   - frame: the name of the corresponding frame in FrameNet
   - verb:  the verb lexical unit from FrameNet
   - sensekey [sensekey]: one or more sense keys indicating the 
     corresponding sense(s) from WordNet 

Sense keys do not depend on the WordNet version, and thus any 
WordNet version can be used to identify the synset corresponding
to a verb sense. Note however that the mapping was created using
WordNet 2.0, which means that earlier versions of WordNet are not
guaranteed to include all sense keys.

Lexical units not found in WordNet are annotated with a sense of
0. Entries for which an appropriate WordNet sense could not be
identified are also annotated with sense 0.

Please report any problems or inconsistencies to leishi at unt.edu
